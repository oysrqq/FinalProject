Library Management System

This is a simple Library Management System implemented in Java. It allows users to add books, view all books, search for books by title, and save/load the book list to/from a file.


- Add a new book with a title and author.
- View all books in the library.
- Search for a book by its title.
- Save the book list to a file.
- Load the book list from a file.

The `Book` class represents a book with a title and an author. It implements the `Serializable` interface to allow objects of this class to be serialized.
